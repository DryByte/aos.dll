# Welcome to the hell
This is a project aiming to add new things to classic Voxlap using DLL injection, right now the code looks really disgusting, shit, awful, and spaghetti... Later we fix it, or just make it worst.

### Current Features
- Customizable FPS (get rid of the 60fps cap)
- Support VersionInfo packet
- Support Extension for messages on screen
- Modloader support (in game skin change)
- Different skin per team, add suffix to the skin: \_G/\_B
- Macros

### Building
Create the build directory, and built it ;)
