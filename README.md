# Welcome to the hell
This is a project aiming to add new things to classic Voxlap using DLL injection, right now the code looks really disgusting, shit, awful, and spaghetti... Later we fix it, or just make it worst.

Check what aos.dll differs from classic Ace of Spades: [CHANGES.md](CHANGES.md)

### Building
Create the build directory, and build it ;)

### Installing/injecting
You can use your favorite DLL injector, or use [AoS Patcher](https://github.com/DryByte/AoS-Patcher) for auto inject when game opens up
